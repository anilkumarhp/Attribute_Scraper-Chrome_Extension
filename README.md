# Attribute_Scraper-Chrome_Extension

This a simple Chrome Extension which will select all the element of the active web-page and scrap the values assigned to its attributes.
In this project I have used only 4 attributes, id, class, name and type. you can select all or one attribute type and extract the value of those attributes and save it in csv file format.
